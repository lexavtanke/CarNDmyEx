    "### Fitting on Large Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider in our current implementation of sliding window search is what happens when we arrive at the left or right edge of an image, such as when there is a large curve on the road ahead. If minpix is not achieved (i.e. the curve ran off the image), the starting position of our next window doesn't change, so it is just positioned directly above the previous window. This will repeat for however many windows are left in nwindows, stacking the sliding windows vertically against the side of the image, and likely leading to an imperfect polynomial fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of a way to solve this issue? If you want to tackle the curves on the harder challenge video as part of the project, you might want to include this in your lane finding algorithm."
